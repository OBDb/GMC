# GMC

This repository contains default signal set configurations for GMC vehicles. This repository serves as a default fallback when a given make does not have its own signalset definitions, ensuring that basic functionality can be maintained across GMC's diverse vehicle lineup.

## Purpose

This repository provides a standardized set of signal configurations that can be used as a fallback option when make-specific or model-specific signal definitions are not available. These configurations represent common signal patterns found across GMC vehicles and can be used as a starting point for custom configurations.

## Generations

GMC (General Motors Truck Company) has evolved significantly since its inception, with several notable eras defining the brand's development:

- **Early Formation (1912-1943)**: GMC was established when General Motors acquired Rapid Motor Vehicle Company and Reliance Motor Car Company. During this period, GMC focused primarily on producing commercial trucks and military vehicles. The brand gained recognition during World War I and II for its reliable military trucks.

- **Post-War Expansion (1944-1967)**: Following World War II, GMC expanded its truck lineup and began to develop more consumer-oriented vehicles. This era saw the introduction of iconic models like the GMC pickup trucks and the innovative GMC Suburban. The brand established itself as a major player in the American truck market.

- **Diversification (1968-1998)**: During this period, GMC broadened its vehicle portfolio beyond traditional trucks to include SUVs and vans. The introduction of models like the Jimmy (later Yukon) and Safari van demonstrated GMC's commitment to versatility. The brand also began to position itself as a more premium alternative to Chevrolet trucks.

- **Premium Positioning (1999-2009)**: GMC reinforced its position as GM's premium truck division with the introduction of the Denali sub-brand in 1999. This era marked a significant shift toward luxury-oriented trucks and SUVs, with enhanced interior features and distinctive styling elements becoming hallmarks of GMC vehicles.

- **Modern Era (2010-Present)**: In recent years, GMC has continued to refine its premium truck and SUV lineup while embracing new technologies. The brand has introduced advanced features such as the MultiPro tailgate and AT4 off-road package, while also exploring electrification with vehicles like the Hummer EV and Sierra EV, positioning GMC at the forefront of the electric truck revolution.
